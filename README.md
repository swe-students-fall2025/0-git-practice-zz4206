[Vibe Coding: AI Transforms Software Engineering in 2025](https://www.webpronews.com/vibe-coding-ai-transforms-software-engineering-in-2025/)

As senior engineers lean into AI coding, I can’t help but worry that entry-level jobs and junior roles might get squeezed out. Normally, we juniors cut teeth on the smaller fixes and debugging, but if AI takes over that space and seniors are just there to correct its bigger errors, then where do we even start? We still need people to grow into seniors eventually, but if the early stepping stones vanish, it feels like the path is closing off before new engineers even get a chance.
